# dev-team

A Claude Code plugin that adds a full persona-driven AI development team to any project. The Orchestrator routes tasks to specialized agents, inline review checkpoints catch quality issues during implementation, and skills provide reusable knowledge modules that any agent can draw on.

For the workflow overview, team philosophy, and three-phase (Research → Plan → Implement) process, see the [repository README](../../README.md).

## Codex Compatibility

This plugin can be installed locally in Codex through the repo-local marketplace. See [Codex Compatibility](../../docs/codex-compatibility.md) for the Codex install path and the compatibility boundary for Claude-only agents, hooks, prompts, and slash commands.

## Install

### Prerequisites

**Required:**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- `jq` — used by hooks for JSON parsing
  - macOS: `brew install jq`
  - Linux: `apt install jq` or `yum install jq`
- `gh` — [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), used by `/pr` and `/issues-from-plan` for creating PRs and issues
  - macOS: `brew install gh`
  - Linux: see [GitHub CLI install docs](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
  - Then authenticate: `gh auth login`

**Optional — by feature:**

| Tool(s) | Required for | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `semgrep` | `/semgrep-analyze`, static analysis pre-pass in `/code-review` | See below |
| `playwright` | `/browse` (browser-based QA) | See below |
| `hadolint`, `trivy`, `grype` | `/docker-image-audit` | See below |

**Optional — auto-formatting (detected per language):**

The `post-format` hook auto-formats files on every edit. It detects available formatters and degrades silently if none are installed. Install the ones relevant to your stack:

| Tool | Language | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prettier` | JS/TS/CSS/HTML/JSON | `npm install -D prettier` (project-local) |
| `eslint` | JS/TS | `npm install -D eslint` (project-local) |
| `ruff` | Python | `pip install ruff` or `brew install ruff` |
| `black` | Python (fallback if ruff absent) | `pip install black` |
| `gofmt` | Go | Included with Go toolchain |
| `rustfmt` | Rust | `rustup component add rustfmt` |
| `rubocop` | Ruby | `gem install rubocop` (or add to Gemfile) |
| `google-java-format` | Java | `brew install google-java-format` or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/releases) |
| `ktlint` | Kotlin | `brew install ktlint` or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/releases) |
| `dotnet format` | C# | Included with .NET SDK 6+ |

**Optional — quality gates in `/pr` (detected per stack):**

`/pr` auto-detects test runners, type checkers, and linters based on project manifests. No configuration needed — if the tool is installed and the project has the relevant config file, it runs automatically.

| Tool | Detected via | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tsc` | `tsconfig.json` | `npm install -D typescript` (project-local) |
| `mypy` | `mypy.ini` or `pyproject.toml` [mypy] | `pip install mypy` |
| `pylint` | `which pylint` | `pip install pylint` |
| `golangci-lint` | `which golangci-lint` | `brew install golangci-lint` or [install docs](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/) |

#### Installing semgrep

```bash
pip install semgrep
# or: brew install semgrep
# or: pipx install semgrep
```

#### Installing Playwright

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

Requires Node.js. Used by `/browse` for browser-based visual QA.

#### Installing hadolint, trivy, grype

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install hadolint trivy grype

# Linux
# hadolint
curl -sL -o /usr/local/bin/hadolint \
  "https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases/latest/download/hadolint-Linux-x86_64"
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hadolint

# trivy
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# grype
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

All three also run as Docker containers if you prefer not to install locally — see the [docker-image-audit skill docs](skills/docker-image-audit/SKILL.md) for details.

### Install

Installation is two steps: register the marketplace, then install the plugin. The marketplace is named **`bfinster`** (the `name` field in `marketplace.json`); the plugin is **`dev-team`**. `claude plugin marketplace add` accepts a GitHub `owner/repo`, any git URL, or a local path; `claude plugin install` takes `<plugin>@<marketplace>`.

**From GitHub (recommended):**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add bdfinst/agentic-dev-team
claude plugin install dev-team@bfinster
```

The `owner/repo` shorthand and the full `https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team` URL are equivalent.

**From a self-hosted or other git host** (GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, Azure DevOps, on-prem):

End the URL with `.git` so Claude Code clones the repository instead of treating the URL as a direct link to a `marketplace.json`, and append `#<branch-or-tag>` to pin a ref. The repository must contain `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at its root.

```bash
# HTTPS (private repos use your git credential helper)
claude plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.example.com/team/agentic-dev-team.git

# SSH
claude plugin marketplace add git@gitlab.example.com:team/agentic-dev-team.git

# pin a release tag
claude plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.example.com/team/agentic-dev-team.git#dev-team-v6.6.0

# then, for any of the above:
claude plugin install dev-team@bfinster
```

For a private host that needs a token, embed a **read-scoped** token in the URL — `https://<user>:<token>@host/team/agentic-dev-team.git` — but never commit it or paste it in chat (Azure DevOps PATs need **Code (Read)** scope). Behind a corporate proxy, clone first and add the local path: `git clone <url> /path/to/clone && claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/clone`.

**Scope and monorepo options** — these flags apply to `marketplace add` and `install`:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--scope user` | You, across all projects (**default**) |
| `--scope project` | All collaborators in this repo (writes `.claude/settings.json`) |
| `--scope local` | You, this repo only (writes `.claude/settings.local.json`) |
| `--sparse .claude-plugin plugins` | Limit the marketplace checkout to these directories — for monorepos; `marketplace add` only |

### Upgrading

Run `/upgrade` from any session, or update manually:

```bash
claude plugin update --scope <scope> dev-team@bfinster
```

To re-point the marketplace (e.g., after moving git hosts), remove it by its **marketplace name** (`bfinster`) and re-add the source:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace remove bfinster
claude plugin marketplace add bdfinst/agentic-dev-team
```

### Verify

After starting Claude Code, confirm the system is working:

```
> What agents are available on this team?
```

## What's included

- **12 team agents** — Orchestrator, Software Engineer, QA Engineer, Architect, Product Manager, etc.
- **19 review agents** — security-review, domain-review, test-review, naming-review, …
- **74 skills** — 41 agent-loaded (TDD, design-doc, competitive-analysis, …) + 33 user-invocable slash commands (`/plan`, `/build`, `/pr`, `/code-review`, `/browse`, `/triage`, …)
